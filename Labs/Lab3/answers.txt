(2.2)pow(3) link with -lm

(3.1)main thread passed arguments by using a struct called thread_args.
     When main creates a thread, it allocation some memory in heap for 
     the struct, and has pointer to the variables in the struct.

(3.2)calloc set the memory to zero when it intializing the memory. 
     We want the values of the variables in the struct 'thread_args'
     (Which are int and double data types) to be zero.

(3.3)if a thread is in detached state, it can never be joined.
     for this program,it should not created detached threads cause
     the main would need the computation results from its threads.

(3.4)main uses tstatus as a pointer to tags.The tstatus indicates 
     which thread’s argument struct and the tags is a pointer which 
     points to the arguments inside the struct. Main uses a for loop
     for receiving results.

(3.5)there is nothing printed out. None of the threads prints.

(3.6)the child thread stops its current process and runs “/bin/ls”,
     and the program ends.

(5) I can’t. The termination time of the thread is gotten and printed
    before it actually exit.
