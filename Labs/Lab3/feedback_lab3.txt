Problem 3: Thread Questions

calloc does zero memory, but it also automatically determines the number of bytes required for a structure, something that malloc does not do automatically. -2
For answer5, the entire program terminates. -2

Problem 4: Program Execution Time

Problem 5: Thread Execution Time

-> summation5.c, answers.txt

The problem is that ctime() is not a thread safe function because it uses a shared buffer with all threads. This creates a race condition where one thread may print another's termination time. Using ctime_r() instead of ctime() will avoid this problem entirely.
