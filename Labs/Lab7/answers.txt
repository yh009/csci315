1.1)From my observation, the program runs without getting into any deadlock. 

1.2)Yes,the deadlock could happen. 
    hold&wait: each philosopher go ahead and hold on to the chopstick on his left before
               his get the other one on the right. If the right chopstick is taken, he
               still hold on to what he has and wait.
               APPLY.
    mutual exclusion: Since i used mutex for the chopsticks. This apply.
               APPLY.
    circular wait: philosophers and the chopsticks are in circular lists.
               APPLY.
    no preemption: Apply.
    ALL 4 conditions apply to this situation. Deadlock possible.
