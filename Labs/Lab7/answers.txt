1.1)From my observation, the program gets into deadlock very quickly. 

1.2)Yes,the deadlock could happen. 
    hold&wait: each philosopher go ahead and hold on to the chopstick on his left before
               his get the other one on the right. If the right chopstick is taken, he
               still hold on to what he has and wait.
               APPLY.
    mutual exclusion: Since i used mutex for the chopsticks. This apply.
               APPLY.
    circular wait: philosophers and the chopsticks are in circular lists.
               APPLY.
    no preemption: Apply.
    ALL 4 conditions apply to this situation. Deadlock possible.

2.1)Each pilosopher picks up the chopstick on his left first and nap for a random amount 
    of time before go grab the other one on his right. In this situation, after every one
    grabbed the chopstick on the left, the program can’t progress anymore and run in
    deadlock.

3.1)No,there shouldn’t be deadlock.We took away one of the four essential conditions
    of deadlock:circular wait.
