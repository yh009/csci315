(b) Here UDP socket is connectionless. Hence we can 
    send message immediately.since we have no connection, the messages have 
    to be addressed to their destination.
    recvfrom() is used to receive message from a socket, the socket can be 
    connectionless. 
    sendto() is used to send message across a connectionless socket.
    User can specify a destination address in recvfrom() and sendto().

(c) Both TCP and UDP are protocols used for sending packets over the Internet.
    TCP is connection-oriented protocol, while UDP is connectionless protocol.
    TCP sends message in order, while UDP sends message no ordered.
    TCP is heavyweight,while UDP is lightweight.
    TCP reads data as data stream(no begin/end for packet),while UDP sends and 
    read a packet as a whole.

(e) every time i ran send_upd, the received pid increments by 1.
