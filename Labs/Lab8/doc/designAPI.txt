1) instead of void *allocate(size_t size), i wrote three different allocate
functions: void *allocate_first(size_t size);void allocate_best(size_t size); 
void *allocate_worst(size_t size).

allocate_first: find the first hole from the free_list that fits and allocate that hole.

allocate_best: traverse through the free_list and find the smallest hole that fits.

allocate_worst: traverse through the free_list and find the largest hole that fits.
