1.1) Seg Fault occurs when a reference of a variable falls outside of the segment where that
     variable resides, or when a write is attempted to a location that is in the illegal memory 
     location.

1.2) Compared with using bit map, the doubly-linked list is easier to implement. Doubly-linked list
     also minimize external fragmentation. However, doubly-linked list cause possibly results in 
     large internal fragmentation. 

1.3) C programs call malloc and free frequently. Another stategy is using TLB for memory management.
     I think using TLB is better becasue it involves less computation and easier get to the memory 
     location we want. 

1.4) External fragmentation is the unused memory blocks between portions of allocated memory.

1.5) Internal fragmentation occurs when the memory allocator leaves extra space empty inside 
     of a block of memory that has been allocated. 

1.6) First fit allocates memory from the first large enough hole encountered in the memory space.
     Pro: Fastest,least time for analyzing. 
     Con: potentially large external fragmentation.

1.7) Best fit allocates a process in the smallest block of unallocated memory in which it will fit.
     Pro: Potentially least external fragmentation
     Con: Slower than first fit
          Less likely that another process can fit in the leftover.

1.8) Worst fit allocates a process in the largest block of unallocated memory avaiable. 
     Pro: Increase the chance that another process can use the leftover space.
     Con: Slower than first fit
          Potentially more external fragmentaion
