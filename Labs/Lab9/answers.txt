(1.1) External fragmentation is possible,since there can be small holes left in the
      free_list that can’t fit in any program. 

(1.2) (a)How fast the allocator is? By measuring the average time it takes to 
         allocate a program into memory.
      (b)How efficient the allocator is using memory? By measuring the difference
         between total memory required for all programs and the total memory space.
         Under the condition that the memory is fully occupied.

(1.3) double average_frag(){
          /*return a value which indicates average fragmentation.
            average fragmentation = (free - freema)/free
            free = total size of free space
            freemax =  size of largest free block
          */
          int free_space=0;
          int free_max;
          double result;
          struct dnode *free ＝ free_list->front;
          struct dnode *worst = free_list->front;
          int ptr;
          
          while(free != NULL){
                ptr = free->size;
                free_space = free_space + ptr;
                if(free->size>=size &&free->size>worst->size){
                     worst = free;
                }
                free = free->next;
          }
          free_max = (int)(worst->size);

          result = (free_space-free_max)/free_space;
          return result;
       }
                

(2.1) I think it’s not enough. It’s missing one detail:to augment integer r.
      correct pseudo-code:
      
//Handle standard input
//initialize custom memory allocator

srandom(seed); // initialize PRNG
 
int r=0;
 
void *p = NULL;
 
while (r < requests) {
 
  s = a random number between 100 and 1000;
 
  p = allocate(algorithm, s)
  // this will require you to change your allocate function
  // so that it accepts the algorithm parameter to select an
  // allocation policy
 
  deallocate(p);

  r++;
}
