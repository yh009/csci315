(1.1) External fragmentation is possible,since there can be small holes left in the
      free_list that can’t fit in any program. 

(1.2) (a)How fast the allocator is? By measuring the average time it takes to 
         allocate a program into memory.
      (b)How efficient the allocator is using memory? By measuring the difference
         between total memory required for all programs and the total memory space.
         Under the condition that the memory is fully occupied.

          /*return a value which indicates average fragmentation.
            average fragmentation = (free - freema)/free
            free = total size of free space
