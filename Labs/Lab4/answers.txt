(4.1) fork just creates a copy of current process. In this lab, we used 
      TCP sockets for inter process communication between two different 
      processes, which are not a copy of each other. They have no parent-
      child relationship.

(4.2) socket functionality provided by an external C library. Because socket(3)
      which means it's a C library function. Also <sys/socket.h> is the location
      of the header after a make_headers_install, which is meant to be used
      by userspace apps.

(4.3) When we want interprocess communication ONLY WITHIN a specific host,
      we can use pipe.Other than that, we need socket, because socket can
      handle communication between processes in different host. 

(4.4) gethostbyname() returns a structure of type hostent for the given
      host name. 
      struct hostent *gethostbyname(const char *name);

(4.5) getaddrinfo()
