(P1) socket(2) and pipe(2) are both used in byte stream communications. 
     But pipe(2) can only used in communication among localhost processes,while
     sockets can extend beyond localhost. 
     socket(2) and open(2) both return a file descriptor upon success.
     But open(2) can’t be used in any communication among processes.

(P2) 1. By using the ‘struct sockaddr_in’ to hold the other process’s address, 
        one program addresses the other program for communication over a TCP socket.

     2. When a socket is created, it exists in a name space but has no address 
        assigned to it. bind(2) assigns the address specified by addr to the 
        socket referred to by the file descriptor sockfd.
  
     3. connect(2) is used to connect the socket to the specified server address.
 
     4. listen(2) marks the socket as passive and will be used to accept incoming
        connection requests.

     5. accept(2) extracts the first connection request on the queue for the listening
        socket, creates a new connected socket and returns a new file descriptor referring
        to that socket. 

     6. We can use send(2) and recv(2) to send and receive message from the socket.
        they are very much like read(2) and write(2) for pipes, except they have a 
        flag argument.
