(1.2) child process gets separate instance of global variable declared in parent process, 
which means change of ‘num’ in one doesn’t affect ‘num’ in the other.

(2.a) x,i are in data segment, because they are global variables.
      pid,y,j are in stack segment, because they are local variables without being
allocated manually.
