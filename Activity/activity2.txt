Problem 1 
a. 2 processes
b. Only one process can execute at a certain time in the critical section. It notifies the other process when something is already executing to make sure that there is only one process contained in the critical section.
c. Yes, because the while loop makes sure that only one process can enter and be in the critical section at a time.
d. They will both be stuck in the while loop.
e. Mutual exclusion- Yes, because only one process can be in the critical section at a time.
    Progress - Yes, once one process finishes it will enter the remainder section and therefore the next process can then decide when it will enter the critical section.
    Bounded Waiting - No, there is no  flag to record how many times a process has entered the critical section.
